# Day 6 Solution

### Part 1

Go through the string and check if the next 4 characters are unique (a nice way is to use Python's sets)

### Part 2

Same as part 1 but with 14 characters.

Surprisingly simple! I initially hardcoded the 4 characters indices, and when I switched to 14 characters I had a few typos... missed my chance at top 20.
