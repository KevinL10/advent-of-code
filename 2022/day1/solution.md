# Day 24 Solution

### Part 1

Keep track of the current maximum, as well as the current Elf's sum as you go through the list. Everytime you see a newline, reset the current sum.

### Part 2

Similar to part 1, but store the sums in an array everytime you see a newline. Sort the resulting array and take the 3 largest elements.
