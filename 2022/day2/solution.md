# Day 2 Solution

### Part 1

I didn't try to come up with anything clever - you can hardcode all possible cases depending on what you choose.

### Part 2

Same as Part 1, you can hardcode all possible scenarios of you and the opponent.

### Thoughts

Made an incorrect submission which cost me top 10 - should test against the sample case in the future.
