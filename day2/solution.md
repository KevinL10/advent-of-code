# Day 2 Solution

### Part 1

Simple implementation, keeping track of the horizontal position and depth.

### Part 2

Similar to Part 1, but introducing a third variable `aim`.

### Thoughts
Didn't read carefully and thought that `down` would be subtracting depth... ended up submitting the negative of the actual answer :(
