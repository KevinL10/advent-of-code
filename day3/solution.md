# Day 3 Solution

### Part 1

Go through each index at a time, keeping track of the most common bits and least common bits in separate variables.

### Part 2

Use two arrays to keep the most common values/least common values, filtering out each value index by index.

### Thoughts
Part 1 went pretty well (especially in Python), although you should be careful about how you remove unwanted values from each array in Part 2.
